This Repository is used to store my practice projects to further grow my web development abilities. This file will contain a list of projects that will be added to as I develop more.

Project 1: Survey Form
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project will allow the user to fill out a pre determined 5 question survey. Once the page is opened the user will be prompted with a simple page with a multiple choice survey question. Once the user has filled out the question there will be a "Continue" button to move on to the next question. Questions can also be freely navigated at any time with arrows on the screen. Once all questions are answered the user can view data from all previous responses.
